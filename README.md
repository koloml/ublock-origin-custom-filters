# uBlock Origin Custom Filters

Small set of custom filters for annoying parts of the sites I'm often using. This list is only used & tested for 
uBlock Origin extension.

## How to add

You can subscribe to specific filters by clicking the links below. You can subscribe only to specific parts of the list
in case you don't want some of these filters to be applied. Each parent filter will automatically include all the child
filters in the list.

Unfortunately, there is no way to make these filters toggleable in the uBlock Origin interface.
